a. 
Describe the long-term behavior of the graph graph. How does this behavior compare to that of the basic quartic? How does the sign of the lead coefficient affect the graph?

b. 
How many [`x`]-intercepts does the graph have? [__]{$xint}

    How many turning points? [__]{$turn}

[@ image( insertGraph($gr) ) @]***  

a. 
The end behavior is the same as for the basic quartic because the lead coefficient is positive.

b. 
There are [$xint]  [`x`] -intercepts, one turning point, no inflection point.
