a. 
Write the piecewise definition for [` \left| [$f] \right| `].

    [`\hphantom{000000000}`]  [__________]{$nf}  if [`x \lt`][__]{ $h}

    [` \left| [$f] \right| =`]

    [`\hphantom{000000000}`]  [__________]{$f}   if [`x \ge `][__]{ $h}

b. 
Use your answer to part (a) to write two inequalities that together are equivalent to 
[` \left| [$f] \right| \lt [$k] `].

    [@ $mc -> print_q() @]***

    [@ $mc -> print_a() @]***

c. 
Solve the inequalities in part (b) and check that the solutions agree with the solutions of 
[` \left| [$f] \right| \lt [$k] `].

    Solution: [_________]  [@AnswerFormatHelp("inequalities") @]*

d. 
Show that [` \left| [$f] \right| \lt [$k] `] is equivalent to the compound inequality 
[` -[$k] \lt [$f] \lt [$k] `].

    The solution to the compound inequality [` -[$k] \lt [$f] \lt [$k] `] is

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

a. 
[`  [$f]  = 0 `] when [` x = [$h]`].

    [`  | [$f] | = [$f] `] when [` [$f] \ge 0`], namely when [` x \ge [$h]`].

    Otherwise [`  | [$f] | = -([$f]) `]

b. 
One inequality is obtained by simply dropping the absolute value from around [`[$f]`] to obtain [` [$f] \lt [$k] `]. The other inequality is obtained by replacing [`[$f]`]  with its opposite: [` -([$f])  \lt [$k] `].

c. 
There are two solutions to [` [$f] = [$k] `], namely [`[$left] `] and [` [$right] `]. All value of [`x`] between these two are solutions to both the inequalities from part (b): [` [$ans] `].

d. 
We could solve the compound inequality [` -[$k] \lt [$f] \lt [$k] `] by adding [`[$b]`] and then dividing by [`[$a]`] on all three parts to get [` [$ans] `], which is equivalent to the solution of the inequality 
[` \left| [$f] \right| \lt [$k] `].
